Use the `<Steps>` component to style numbered lists of tasks. This is useful for more complex step-by-step guides where each step needs to be clearly highlighted.

Wrap `<Steps>` around a standard Markdown ordered list. All the usual Markdown syntax is applicable inside `<Steps>`.

## Example

<Steps>
  1. Import the component into your MDX file:

     ```jsx title=src/content/docs/example.mdx
     import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components
     ```
  2. Wrap \`\<Steps>\` around your ordered list items.
</Steps>

````jsx title=src/content/docs/example.mdx
<Steps>

1. Import the component into your MDX file:

   ```js
   import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
   ```

2. Wrap `<Steps>` around your ordered list items.

</Steps>
````

## Keystatic config

To add this Starlight component as a Keystatic content component, register it as a content component with the following schema:

```tsx title=keystatic.config.tsx
Steps: wrapper({
  label: 'Steps',
  description: 'Use the <Steps> component to style numbered lists of tasks.',
  schema: {},
}),
```
