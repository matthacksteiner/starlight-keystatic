A code block is indicated by a block with three backticks ` ``` ` at the start and end. You can indicate the programming language being used after the opening backticks.

```jsx title=src/content/docs/example.mdx
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l);
  return true;
};
```

## Keystatic configuration

No configuration is needed as Keystatic has built in support for code blocks.
