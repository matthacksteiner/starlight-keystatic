Use the `<FileTree>` component to display the structure of a directory with file icons and collapsible sub-directories.

Specify the structure of your files and directories with an [unordered Markdown list](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#unordered-lists) inside `<FileTree>`. Create a sub-directory using a nested list or add a `/` to the end of a list item to render it as a directory without specific content.

The following syntax can be used to customize the appearance of the file tree:

* Highlight a file or directory by making its name bold, e.g. `**README.md**`.
* Add a comment to a file or directory by adding more text after the name.
* Add placeholder files and directories by using either `...` or `â€¦` as the name.

## Example

<FileTree>
  * index.astro
  * **keystatic.config.tsx**
  * components
    * file-tree.astro
    * ...
</FileTree>

```jsx title=src/content/docs/example.mdx
<FileTree>
  * index.astro
  * **keystatic.config.tsx**
  * components
    * file-tree.astro
    * ...
</FileTree>
```

## Keystatic config

To add this Starlight component as a Keystatic content component, register it as a content component with the following schema:

```tsx title=keystatic.config.tsx
...
FileTree: wrapper({
  label: 'File tree',
  description:
    'Use the <FileTree> component to display the structure of a directory with file icons and collapsible sub-directories.',
  schema: {},
}),
...
```
